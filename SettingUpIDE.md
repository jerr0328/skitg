# Introduction #

Our code is developed in Eclipse. We are making this work in both a desktop Java environment as well as Android. The tools you will need for this are:
  * [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/indigosr2)
  * [Android SDK (ADK)](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
  * Git (EGit for Eclipse, included in Eclipse IDE for Java Developers)
  * [libgdx](http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/downloads/detail?name=libgdx-0.9.2.zip&can=2&q=)
